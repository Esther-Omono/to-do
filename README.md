# Responsive To-Do App

A simple and responsive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also includes a modal for editing tasks, uses Font Awesome for icons, and saves tasks to localStorage so they persist even after a page reloads.
